Heart Rate Monitoring System

Overview
This project demonstrates a real-time heart rate monitoring system using an Arduino board and a heart rate sensor. The system captures pulse data and displays live readings through the Arduino IDE serial monitor on a Windows desktop.

Technologies Used
- Arduino UNO
- Heart Rate Pulse Sensor
- Arduino IDE (Windows)
- Embedded C/C++ (Arduino language)
- Serial Communication

How It Works
1. The heart rate sensor detects the user's pulse when the finger is placed on the sensor.
2. The Arduino reads analog input from the sensor and processes the data using uploaded code.
3. The result is printed to the serial monitor, showing the live pulse rate in beats per minute (BPM).
4. The system runs entirely on the Arduino board with a USB connection to a PC.

Features
- Real-time pulse monitoring
- Simple and low-cost setup
- Easy integration with serial output
- Suitable for health tech beginners and Arduino enthusiasts

How to Run
1. Connect the heart rate sensor to the Arduino (VCC, GND, Signal to analog pin).
2. Upload the code via Arduino IDE.
3. Open the Serial Monitor to view the BPM output.
4. Place your finger gently on the sensor to read heart rate.
